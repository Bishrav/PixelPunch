/* Main Content Area in Pages (optional if needed) */
/* The layout logic: Wrapper is flex-col, content must grow.
   Each page component should ideally flex-grow: 1 or handle their own layout. 
   Given components are separate, let's verify if they have internal structure.
   But App.jsx wrapper makes sure the Router container is 100vh.
   Each PAGE (e.g. LandingPage) typically contains a Navbar and Footer internally. 
   WAIT. If each page has its OWN Footer, simply wrapping App.jsx won't work automatically 
   UNLESS the page itself is flex-col.
   Looking at Shop.jsx, it has <Sidebar>, content, and <Footer>.
   Shop.jsx: minHeight: 100vh. It handles it.
   Let's check other pages if they have issues.
   
   However, common "Sticky Footer" usually implies global layout.
   Since pages invoke <Footer /> manually, the PAGE component needs to be flex-col with content expanding.
   App.jsx wrapper helps if the page component doesn't take 100% height.
   
   Let's add a utility class .page-container to index.css that pages can reuse if they want sticky footer.
